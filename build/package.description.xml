                    This layer provides basic messaging throughout flow package. It is not supposed to be very important
                    and those wanting to replace it with their own solution are encouraged to do so.

                This layer provides basic messaging throughout flow package. It is not supposed to be very important
                and those wanting to replace it with their own solution are encouraged to do so.
                &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
                Right now there is some concerns regarding signals:
                &lt;ul&gt;
                    &lt;li&gt;Circular referencing (passing to each signal its parent&lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;li&gt;Necessity to instantiate a set of signals for each state machine processor may lead to excessive memory consuming&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ul&gt;
                &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
                First issue seems to be minor one, as signals now are handled together with their parent sets,
                and should be garbage collected properly even with flash garbage collector.
                &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
                Second issue may be serious enough, although it require testing, how much is used, how fast it is, etc.
                For now, I'll leave it as is for the sake of being short and already working, but signals layer
                is the candidate for reviewing/rewriting, after flow is done and running.
                &lt;/p&gt;
